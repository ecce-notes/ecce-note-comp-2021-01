The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is the next generation of precision QCD facility to be built at Brookhaven National Laboratory in conjunction with Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory. There are a significant number of software and computing challenges that need to be overcome at the EIC. During the EIC detector proposal development period, the ECCE consortium began identifying and addressing these challenges in the process of producing a complete detector proposal based upon detailed detector and physics simulations. In this document, the software and computing efforts to produce this proposal are discussed; furthermore, the computing and software model and resources required for the future of ECCE are described.
