%could be one of the first large-scale experiments where AI is systematically employed from the detector and design 

The EIC can be one of the first large-scale experiments to systematically incorporate and employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) in its program, starting from the detector design and R\&D phases. 
The relevance of AI for the EIC has been highlighted among the \textit{Opportunities for Computing} of the EIC Yellow Report \cite{eic_yellow_report_v1_1}.

ECCE recognizes the important role that AI can play at various stages of the future EIC experiment and includes in its structure a working group dedicated to AI-based applications. 
AI potentially permeates all aspects of the Computing Plan, and appears throughout the whole document.

The first workshop on Artificial Intelligence for the Electron Ion Collider (AI4EIC) held at CFNS in September 2021 \cite{AI4EIC_workshop} has been a fundamental venue for the EIC community to start addressing how AI might contribute to advance research, design and operation of the future EIC across all the phases of the EIC schedule (see \cite{AI4EIC_future}).
%---- structure of AI4EIC 
The workshop was structured into different sessions focusing on experimental applications of AI for \textit{Accelerator and Detector Design}, \textit{Simulations}, \textit{Reconstruction and Analysis}, \textit{Accelerator and Detector Control}, \textit{Detector Readout} and \textit{Computing Frontiers}. 
%
As a result of this discussion it turned out AI techniques are expected to play a role since the design and R\&D phases of EIC. 

It is in fact clear the advantage of AI techniques in searching the optimal solutions in a complex multi-dimensional parameter space such as in the design of a detector. Detector design requires accurate simulations based on Geant4 \cite{ALLISON2016186}. Those simulations are typically compute intensive and another advantage of using AI is minimizing the computing budget needed to come up with an optimal solution (see, \textit{e.g.}, the results of an AI-supported design of a complex detector system like the dual-RICH \cite{cisbani2020ai}).
%AI can be also utilized for the optimization of materials used within detectors for improved performance. 

%Simulations - fast simulations - ATLAS example 

The AI4EIC session on Simulations highlighted the need for faster simulations. The ATLAS Collaboration at CERN for example is already including a GAN \cite{creswell2018generative} in AtlFast3, the next generation of high-accuracy fast simulation in ATLAS \cite{atlas2021atlfast3}. 
%for fast simulations at intermediate energies.   
The EIC detector has unique features. For example, the backbone of particle identification is with imaging Cherenkov detectors \cite{he2020rich} (DIRC in the central region, mRICH in the e-going direction and dRICH in the h-going direction of the ECCE detector), which are typically characterized by compute intensive simulations and complex pattern recognition problems, that can benefit from novel AI-based approaches that have been recently proposed (see, \textit{e.g.}, \cite{fanelli2020deeprich}). %(see, \textit{e.g.}, \cite{ali2020gluex}).

%Reconstruction - EIC detector has unique features. The backbone of PID is Cherenkov detectors. Compute intensive simulations and complex pattern recognition problems for imaging Cherenkov detectors like DIRC.  
 AI is also expected to play a role in high-level physics analysis, for example in jet physics to empower taggers for boosted jets and identify quark flavor within the jets (see ML4Jets workshops \cite{ml4jets}).    

Another important aspect came from the Accelerator and Detector Control session of AI4EIC: in fact EIC can been envisaged as one the first experiments to be largely automated and endowed with intelligence in control workflows (see, \textit{e.g.}, \cite{Hydra2021} as discussed in Sec.~\ref{subsec:online_mon}).  

The EIC community is also moving towards a trigger-less Streaming Readout (SRO) approach to detector readout as discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:online}. 
This represents a unique opportunity to streamline workflows for online and offline data processing in HEP and NP experiments, and to take advantage of emerging technologies such as \textit{e.g.}, heterogenous computing with AI/ML as discussed in the Computing Frontiers session of AI4EIC.
Within the new paradigm of SRO, AI is expected to play a major role in providing fast alignment/calibration/reconstruction for near real-time analyses.
