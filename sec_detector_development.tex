\subsection{Detector Optimization}
\label{sec:codesign}
\textbf{\emph{Cristiano}}


%The optimization is an essential part of the R\&D and design process.
%An unprecedented study in detector design using AI has been accomplished and a framework for multi-objective optimization of the ECCE design has been developed. 
%Our approach deals with a complex optimization in a multidimensional design space driven by multiple objectives that encode the detector performance, while satisfying several mechanical constraints. 
%%This approach can be further utilized 
%%We describe our strategy and show preliminary results for the Si tracking system. 


% Future: scaling workflow on HPC system
